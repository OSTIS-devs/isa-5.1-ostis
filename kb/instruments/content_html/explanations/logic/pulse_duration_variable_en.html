<p><b><sc_element sys_idtf  = "concept_pulse_duration_variable">Pulse duration, variable</sc_element></b> is a basic digital logic gate for which the following rules hold:<br>
	• Output [O] changes from (0) to (1) when input [I] changes from (0) to (1).<br>
	• Output [O] changes from (1) to (0) when Input [I] has been equal to (1) for time duration (t),
	input [I] changes from (1) to (0), or optional Reset [R] changes to (1).</p>
