<p>a <i>device</i> that receives information as one form of an <i>instrument</i> signal and transmits an output signal as
    another form, such as a current-to-pneumatic signal <i>converter</i>.<br>
    a). an <i>instrument</i> that changes a <i>sensor</i>â€™s output to a standard signal, is properly designated as a
    <i>transmitter</i>, not a <i>converter</i>; typically, a temperature element [TE] connects to a <i>transmitter</i> [TT], not to a
    <i>converter</i> [TY].<br>
    b) a <i>converter</i> is sometimes referred to as a <i>transducer</i>, a completely general term not
    recommended for signal conversion.</p>
